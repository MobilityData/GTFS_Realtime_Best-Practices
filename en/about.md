## About This Document

### Objectives

The objectives of maintaining GTFS Realtime Best Practices are to:

* Improve end-user customer experience in public transportation apps
* Make it easier for software developers to deploy and scale applications, products, and services

### How to propose or amend published GTFS Realtime Best Practices

The Best Practices are in the process of being merged into the spec and some GTFS Best Practices have been merged into the official GTFS Realtime reference and have been removed from this document.

If you'd like to suggest a new best practice, please go to the [GTFS Reference GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/transit/) to open an issue or create a PR, or contact [specifications@mobilitydata.org](mailto:specifications@mobilitydata.org).
