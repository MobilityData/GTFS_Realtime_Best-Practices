# GTFS Realtime Data Best Practices

## Introduction

These are recommended practices for describing realtime public transportation information in the [GTFS Realtime](https://gtfs.org/reference/realtime/v2/) data format.

### Document Structure

Recommended practices are organized into the following primary sections

* __[General Recommendations](general):__ Recommendations for feed publishing and general practices.
* __[Practice Recommendations Organized by Feed](Feeds):__ Recommendations are organized by Feed type.
* __[Practice Recommendations Organized by Message](Messages):__ Recommendations are organized by message and field in the same order described in the official GTFS Realtime reference.
* __[Practice Recommendations Organized by Case](Use-cases):__ With particular cases, such as frequency-based service (vs. schedule-based service), practices may need to be applied across several messages and fields as well as the corresponding GTFS schedule data. Such recommendations are consolidated in this section.
